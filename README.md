## Yazeen Bro Hotels – AI Receptionist 🏨

**Yazeen Bro Hotels** is a smart hotel management platform featuring an AI-powered receptionist that automates and enhances the guest experience. The system is designed to handle everything from reservations to check‑out, offering 24/7 support without the need for constant human intervention.

### What It Does 
The AI receptionist interacts with guests through a chat or voice interface, answering questions, managing bookings, processing payments, and handling special requests. It connects with the hotel’s internal systems to check room availability, assign rooms, and trigger housekeeping or maintenance services. Guests can also receive personalized recommendations for local attractions, restaurants, and activities based on their preferences.
